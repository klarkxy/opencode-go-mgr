# Architecture

This page defines stable dependency and ownership boundaries. Runtime edge
cases, schema history, route inventories, and release procedures stay in their
own chapters so this page does not become a second implementation manual.

## Dependency graph

```text
ocg-gateway -> ocg-domain
ocg-core    -> ocg-domain + ocg-gateway + ocg-infra
ocg-cli     -> ocg-core
src-tauri   -> ocg-core

ocg-browser-worker   separate process; no internal ocg-* dependency
Vue SPA              static assets; HTTP Dashboard V3 only
```

The **Adapter Registry** is static and sealed. Runtime Provider definitions
are typed data bound to Configurable HTTP; they are not adapter implementations
or plugins.

| Crate | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ocg-domain` | IDs, `BUILTIN_PROVIDERS`, `ProviderAdapterKind`, protocol tables, typed dynamic definitions | DB, `CoreState`, HTTP clients, filesystem, clocks |
| `ocg-gateway` | Alias resolution, `AttemptSpec`, classification, selector state machines, no-I/O JSON conversion | DB, `CoreState`, plaintext credentials, outbound HTTP |
| `ocg-infra` | Key obfuscation, proxy-aware HTTP helpers, inference transport, SQLite log statements | Product catalogs, Dashboard DTOs, routing policy |
| `ocg-core` | SQLite, `CoreState`, Dashboard V3, adapters, gateway execution, usage sync, Host composition | Runtime plugin loading; adapter-owned DB or HTTP clients |
| `ocg-cli` / `src-tauri` | Process composition for CLI and Desktop | A second control plane or direct WebView mutation path |

Compatibility facades remain in `ocg-core`, but new no-I/O catalog, selector,
alias, and conversion behavior belongs in the lower crates. Production
dependency guards require a DAG with no multi-node strongly connected
component.

## HTTP composition

`crates/ocg-core/src/host_router.rs` is the composition root for one listener:

```text
127.0.0.1:9042
  inference routes
    OpenAI Chat / Responses / Anthropic Messages
    Gemini generateContent / streamGenerateContent
    Claude Desktop role aliases
    local GET /v1/models
  /dashboard/api/v3       current Dashboard control plane
  /dashboard/api          preserved auth + browser WS; retired REST -> 410
  /dashboard/             Vue SPA and assets
```

The SPA remains an HTTP client. Desktop capabilities are registered into
`CoreState`; there are no Tauri `invoke` commands for Dashboard state.

## Gateway request path

Inference is implemented under `crates/ocg-core/src/gateway/`:

1. `handler.rs` assigns the request id, authenticates a client Key, parses the
   client protocol, rewrites Claude Desktop roles, and resolves model identity.
2. `GatewayExecutor` captures one request-entry snapshot for pricing, proxy
   routes, contracts, and Alias resolution. Fallback iterations re-read live
   account state, eligible Custom runtimes, and Zen Free cooldown.
3. Candidate materialization applies adapter ceilings and effective
   model/protocol state before the no-I/O selector chooses a card.
4. `provider_adapter.rs` exhaustively maps the sealed `ProviderAdapterKind` to
   a data-only `AttemptSpec`. It does not decrypt Keys, open SQLite, or build an
   HTTP client.
5. The Host resolves the selected credential. `forward_once` performs exactly
   one upstream `.send()`; retry and fallback policy stay in the outer loop.
6. Classification decides same-account retry, account fallback, cooldown, or
   terminal return. The Host then converts the response and writes logs.

Unknown or ambiguous model identity fails before outbound HTTP. Timeouts,
stream interruptions, and other outcomes that may have reached the upstream
are not automatically replayed. Full status-specific behavior lives in
[Runtime invariants](runtime-invariants.md).

## Adapter and Provider boundary

`ocg-domain::ProviderRegistry` contains the code-owned built-in Provider rows
and exhaustive adapter kinds. Unknown `provider_id` values fail closed unless
they match a persisted typed Provider definition, which always selects the
existing Configurable HTTP adapter.

Custom API remains an account-owned product path even though it uses the same
sealed adapter kind. CPA is a separate static external integration. Neither
boundary loads user code, extends the enum at runtime, or grants arbitrary
process control.

Provider-owned catalogs and contracts are resolved before account credentials
are used. Saved discovery rows may activate code-owned Alias mappings or remain
exact raw pins; discovery never creates adapter implementations.

## Control plane

The Vue SPA calls `/dashboard/api/v3` through `src/api/dashboard-v3.ts` and its
presenters. CAS-protected mutations carry `expectedRevision` and
`processGeneration`; pricing writes also carry `expectedPricingRevision`.
Operational reads and diagnostics that do not mutate state skip CAS.

The CLI calls the same HTTP-neutral services without an argv CAS token. Shared
services own persistence and revision bumps; neither the CLI nor the frontend
implements a second mutation path.

The settings-specific persist/rebind/compensation sequence is shown in
[Dashboard API](dashboard-api.md#settings-mutation-workflow). Account setup
states are shown in
[State and lifecycle](state-and-lifecycle.md#managed-account-setup-lifecycle).
