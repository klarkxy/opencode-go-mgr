# Release Procedure

1. Set `X.Y.Z` (or `X.Y.Z-beta.N`) in `package.json`,
   `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, both `Cargo.toml` files, and the header
   plus default images in `compose.example.yaml`.
2. Refresh lockfiles with the usual Cargo/pnpm commands, then run
   `pnpm run test`, `pnpm run test:tooling`, `pnpm run design:lint`,
   `pnpm run contract:v3:check`, `pnpm run release:check`, and
   `pnpm run build`. Commit generated lockfile diffs; do not hand-edit them.
3. Review the previous-tag diff and current-platform `release/` payloads,
   then commit version, lockfile, documentation, and release-note changes.
4. Merge first. On the commit already on `main`, annotated-tag
   `vX.Y.Z` and push it. Do not tag a commit that will later be squash-merged.
5. Wait for quality, preflight, the native matrix, `draft-release`,
   `verify-release`, and `publish-release`. Confirm publication converted
   that same draft.
6. Dispatch `container.yml` for the tag
   (`gh workflow run container.yml --ref main -f tag=vX.Y.Z -f publish_latest=true`),
   confirm both GHCR packages are public, and anonymously pull both
   full-version tags.

Published assets and tags are immutable. Fix a bad release with a new
patch version.

## Human checks CI does not run

Protocol, schema, CAS, and local-list behavior belong in `cargo test` /
`pnpm run test`, not this list.

- [ ] Quality gate, signed `release:check`, and selected platform smokes
      are green; the four version manifests, `compose.example.yaml`, and
      workspace `Cargo.lock` entries agree.
- [ ] Launch Claude Desktop and Gemini CLI once each for a text and a
      tool call. Spot-check that application-guide display snippets mask
      the Key and copied results contain the real key.
- [ ] Optional managed onboarding (sign-in identity → invite URL →
      OpenCode login → payment review → key paste). Real payment only when
      explicitly intended. Refresh quota against official
      `/zen/go/v1/usage` on a ready Key account and a ready managed
      account.
- [ ] Windows: SmartScreen text, dashboard, one account, one request,
      `auto_start` ↔ `HKCU\...\Run\Open Console Gateway`, value gone after uninstall.
- [ ] macOS: **Open Anyway**, dashboard, one account, one request.
- [ ] Linux: `.deb` and AppImage under a real Wayland or X11 session.
- [ ] Browser discovery (Edge/Chrome on Windows; platform browsers on
      macOS/Linux), profile isolation, cookie persistence across restart.
- [ ] After publish: `container.yml` green, anonymous pull of both images
      at the expected digests, GitHub Release asset set unchanged.
