# Development

## Prerequisites

Node.js 22, the `packageManager` pin in `package.json`, and the workspace
`rust-version` (Rust 1.88 or newer, as required by the locked dependencies). Native packages are whatever
`.github/workflows/release.yml` installs on that runner.

## Dev loop

Quit the installed tray app so it does not hold the single-instance lock or
port `9042`, then:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

`pnpm run dev` runs `tauri dev` with `OCG_GATEWAY_PORT=19042` so Windows
HNS/WSL/Docker excluded ranges around `9042` do not block the stack.
Installed builds still default to `9042`. Vite serves
`http://127.0.0.1:30001/dashboard/` and proxies `/dashboard/api` (including
WebSockets) to that gateway port. Override both Tauri and Vite with
`OCG_GATEWAY_PORT` before starting; Settings shows the effective port as
read-only while the variable is set.

`pnpm install` enables `.githooks` (`cargo fmt --all` on staged `*.rs`).

## Checks

`package.json` scripts are the names to run. Pick the smallest check that
covers the changed boundary:

| Change | Check |
| --- | --- |
| One frontend or script test | `node --experimental-strip-types --test <file>` |
| Vue / dashboard | adjacent test, then `pnpm run build:web` |
| One Rust crate | `cargo test -p <package>` |
| Core / Dashboard V3 | `cargo test -p ocg-core <filter>` |
| Desktop Host | `cargo test -p ocg-manager --lib` |
| V3 schema or generated types | `pnpm run contract:v3:check` |
| `DESIGN.md` / theme | `pnpm run design:lint` |

`pnpm run test` is the cross-frontend/Rust gate. `pnpm run test:tooling`
covers `scripts/*.test.mjs` and is a release/tooling gate, not part of
`pnpm run test`. `pnpm run build` is release validation only
(`scripts/release.mjs`). Workspace `[profile.release]` uses thin LTO,
`strip`, and `panic = "abort"`.

Rust unit tests live in sibling `tests.rs` modules (`src/db.rs` declares
`mod tests;` and the tests are in `src/db/tests.rs`). Do not add tests that
assert on source text, workflow YAML, or documentation prose.

Application guides are driven by `src/views/application-guides.ts`.

CLI sandbox (OpenCode Go cards only; no Custom, sub keys, or settings):

```bash
ocg-manager-cli --data-dir /tmp/ocg-cli-test key add smoke sk-smoke
ocg-manager-cli --data-dir /tmp/ocg-cli-test serve --port 19042
```

Direct `Database::update_account` does not bump revision; that is
intentional and is not the CLI path.

## Local unsigned smoke (Windows)

Quit the installed release from the tray. Align versions in `package.json`,
`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, both `Cargo.toml` files, and
`compose.example.yaml`, then `pnpm run build`.

Without `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` the script writes plain local packages
that cannot drive in-app upgrades. Optional signing variables:
`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`,
`TAURI_UPDATER_PUBLIC_KEY` (must match
`src-tauri/updater-public-key.sha256`), and
`OCG_REQUIRE_UPDATER_ARTIFACTS=1`.

A local Tauri build may rewrite `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and
`src-tauri/gen/schemas/*.json` — keep only the intended edits.
