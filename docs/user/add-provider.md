# Add a Provider

Use this guide when you want OCG Manager to route to another upstream service. There are three different integration paths:

| Goal | Path | Repository change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add a named Provider this node can reuse across accounts | **Providers** → **New Provider** (user-defined) | No |
| Connect one OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible endpoint on a single account | Add a **Custom API** account | No |
| Ship a named Provider/Plan to every OCG Manager user | Add a sealed built-in Provider | Yes, reviewed code and tests |

The **Adapter Registry** stays static and sealed. User-defined Providers are typed persisted definitions; every one binds the code-owned Configurable HTTP adapter. OCG never loads user scripts, plugins, or binaries. Unknown `provider_id` values fail closed unless they match a saved definition. Custom API remains a distinct account-owned path: it keeps Endpoint, protocol, and model mappings on the account card.

## Create a user-defined Provider

1. Open **Providers** and choose **New Provider**.
2. Enter a name, one API Endpoint, one upstream protocol (Chat Completions, Responses, or Messages), and one auth kind (Bearer, `x-api-key`, or none).
3. Add at least one public-model → exact-upstream-ID mapping. **Fetch models** is optional and does not save.
4. If auth requires a Key, enter the first account name and a write-only Key. A no-auth Provider creates one singleton account without a Key.
5. **Test model** is optional. Confirm the warning first: a real test can consume upstream quota or incur charges.
6. Save. The write is one atomic `POST /providers` and does not require a successful probe.

Edit replaces the whole Provider configuration through `PATCH /providers/{id}`. The Provider id is immutable. Changing none-auth to keyed auth requires an explicit replacement Key. Delete is allowed only after every referencing account is removed; there is no cascade.

Provider-owned fields stay on **Providers**. Account **Key**, enablement, order, notes, cooldown, and tests stay on **Accounts**. User-defined Providers are always unpriced: no official usage, quota estimate, or pricing rows. Request logs still attribute provider, account, and model.

Backups use payload V4 with `providerId` only. Schema v35 stores `dynamic_providers` and `dynamic_provider_models`.

## Connect a compatible upstream now

1. Open **Accounts** and choose **Add account** → **Custom API**.
2. Enter a name, the upstream API Key, one API URL, and one upstream protocol: **Chat Completions**, **Responses**, or **Messages**.
3. Add at least one mapping: a public model name clients request and the exact upstream model ID. **Fetch models** can fill the draft from upstream IDs when the upstream exposes the optional model-list interface below.
4. Save the account. A valid new account is enabled by default; **Test connection** is an optional real, potentially billable request through that exact account.
5. Call authenticated `GET /v1/models` on OCG Manager and confirm the routeable public name is published, then send one inference request.

One Custom account uses one upstream protocol for every mapping on that card. Matching client traffic passes through; other supported client formats are converted to the selected upstream protocol. **Fetch models** returns upstream IDs only; importing one makes `public model = upstream ID` exactly, without suffix stripping or generated Aliases. You may then edit the public name while retaining the exact upstream ID.

## Upstream HTTP interface

OCG resolves common base URLs consistently for model discovery, verification, and production traffic:

| Configured API URL | Inference URL | Optional model-list URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `https://api.example.com` | Adds `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, or `/v1/messages` | `https://api.example.com/v1/models` |
| `https://api.example.com/v1` | Adds `/chat/completions`, `/responses`, or `/messages` | `https://api.example.com/v1/models` |
| A complete standard inference URL | Used exactly as entered | The sibling `/models` |
| A non-standard complete path | Used exactly as entered | Not guessed; enter model IDs manually |

The configured URL must be HTTP or HTTPS and have a host. Embedded credentials, query strings, and fragments are rejected. A trusted administrator may deliberately select a loopback, LAN, or public destination. OCG does not follow redirects.

The selected protocol defines the wire contract:

| Protocol | Standard path | Authentication sent upstream | Required behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | `/v1/chat/completions` | `Authorization: Bearer <upstream-key>` | Accept Chat request JSON and return Chat JSON or Chat SSE |
| OpenAI Responses | `/v1/responses` | `Authorization: Bearer <upstream-key>` | Accept Responses request JSON and return Responses JSON or Responses SSE |
| Anthropic Messages | `/v1/messages` | `x-api-key: <upstream-key>` plus `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` | Accept Messages request JSON and return Messages JSON or Messages SSE |

OCG derives authentication from the protocol. It never sends both auth styles, retries a `401` with another header, or forwards a dashboard/client Key upstream. The response must follow the selected protocol closely enough for OCG's parser and converter, including standard error bodies and `text/event-stream` framing when streaming.

### Optional model discovery

**Fetch models** sends an authenticated `GET` to the resolved model-list URL. Return an OpenAI/Anthropic-style object with a `data` array:

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "id": "model-a" },
    { "id": "model-b" }
  ],
  "has_more": false
}
```

Each usable row needs a non-empty string `id`. For pagination, set `has_more: true`, return `last_id` (or ensure the last usable row has an ID), and accept the next request's `after_id` query parameter. Discovery only updates the unsaved form; it does not save, verify, or enable an account.

## Add a built-in Provider

A built-in integration is appropriate only when the Provider needs product-owned identity, catalog, account lifecycle, routing, pricing/usage, or other semantics that Custom API cannot express. Start from the current code, not an older requirements document.

1. Define stable Provider/Offering identities, the Plan row, credential/quota semantics, and an exhaustive `ProviderAdapterKind` mapping in `crates/ocg-domain/src/ids.rs` and `provider.rs`.
2. Add only verified protocol facts to `crates/ocg-domain/src/protocol.rs`. Request routing must never probe a billable endpoint to guess a protocol.
3. Add code-owned client Alias mappings in `crates/ocg-gateway/src/alias.rs`. Preserve exact upstream IDs and reject ambiguous raw IDs; a discovered row must not silently invent a public Alias.
4. Implement the host route resolver in `ocg-core`. The adapter returns an `AttemptSpec`; database access, Key decryption, proxy selection, and outbound HTTP remain host-owned.
5. Add the account and **Providers** control-plane/UI workflow, including catalog refresh, enablement, verification, errors, cooldown, pricing, and usage only where the Provider actually supports them. Dashboard writes use `/dashboard/api/v3` CAS.
6. Update the paired user guides and tests. At minimum run `cargo test -p ocg-domain`, `cargo test -p ocg-gateway`, `cargo test -p ocg-core`, the relevant frontend tests, and `pnpm run build:web`. Contract changes also require `pnpm run contract:v3:check`.

Before opening a contribution, write down the upstream origin, auth scheme, catalog source, supported model/protocol pairs, streaming behavior, error semantics, quota/price source, and a non-billable validation plan. Keep the new family fail-closed until its complete routing and control-plane path exists.
