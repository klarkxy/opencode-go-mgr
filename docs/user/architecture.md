# Architecture

Open Console Gateway is one local node. Desktop, CLI, and Docker are alternative hosts
for the same `ocg-core` process. The default listener is `127.0.0.1:9042`.
Each node stores its own data locally.

## One local node

[![Open Console Gateway local-node architecture](../diagrams/local-node.visual-check.1440x900.light.png)](https://klarkxy.github.io/open-console-gateway/diagrams/local-node/)

[Open the interactive diagram on GitHub Pages](https://klarkxy.github.io/open-console-gateway/diagrams/local-node/) to switch themes,
trace relationships, or export another format.

The Dashboard and inference endpoints share port `9042`, but they use different
credentials. A client **Key** authenticates an AI tool to Open Console Gateway. After
selection, the account credential is sent only to that account's configured
upstream; Zen Free has no credential. The Vue SPA talks HTTP Dashboard V3.

## Request lifecycle

One inference request follows a fixed order:

1. Authenticate the client **Key** from `access_keys`.
2. Parse the client protocol and resolve an Alias, exact built-in raw ID,
   user-defined Provider public model, or eligible Custom model ID.
3. Materialize compatible accounts, then apply card order and the selected
   strict-priority, global-sticky, or round-robin policy.
4. Build one sealed adapter attempt, resolve that account's credential, and
   send one upstream request. Protocol selection uses the saved contract.
5. Convert the response or SSE stream back to the client format, then record
   request identity, upstream identity, usage, and cooldown state.

Unknown model names return `400`. Ambiguous exact raw IDs return
`ambiguous_model_id` and stay local. Account fallback may continue after
eligible pre-send or provider-specific failures; ambiguous or unsafe requests
fail before selection.

## Product ownership

| Surface | Owns | Related surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Access Keys** | Client-facing primary and sub Keys | Account credentials live on **Accounts** |
| **Accounts** | Account Key, enablement, order, notes, cooldown, usage state | Catalogs and protocol contracts live on **Providers** |
| **Providers** | Built-in catalogs, model/protocol contracts, pricing scopes, typed user-defined Provider Endpoint/auth/mappings | Custom API mappings stay on the account card |
| **Custom API account** | One API URL, one account-wide upstream protocol, public-model → upstream-ID mappings | Shared Provider definitions live on **Providers** |
| **Extensions / CPA** | A static local external-integration boundary | Built-in routing families stay under **Accounts** / **Providers** |
| **Legacy Applications** | Retired; remaining guide and connector code awaits cleanup | Clients use the ordinary Gateway API |

The Adapter Registry is static and sealed. User-defined Providers persist as
typed data and always bind Configurable HTTP.

## Local model lists

These reads use saved local state. Catalog refreshes are explicit actions on
**Providers**.

| Endpoint | Published models |
| --- | --- |
| Authenticated `GET /v1/models` | Currently routeable code-owned Aliases, saved Zen/Command/CN mappings, saved user-defined Provider public models, and eligible Custom declared IDs |
| `GET /dashboard/api/v3/application-models` | Go-routeable Aliases intersected with the current Go pricing snapshot; excludes Custom API, user-defined Providers, and CN Plans |
| `GET /claude-desktop/v1/models` | The three Claude Desktop role aliases only |

Saved catalog rows keep exact raw pins until code assigns an Alias. A Custom ID
that collides with a published built-in Alias is excluded from publication.

## Protocol conversion

Clients may use OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages,
Gemini `generateContent` / `streamGenerateContent`, or Claude Desktop entry
points. A supported and enabled client/upstream pair passes through; otherwise
the whole request and response are converted to and from the model's effective
upstream protocol. Gemini is a client format: the gateway converts it to the
selected Plan's Chat Completions or Messages upstream.

The complete preferred/supported matrix and conversion limits live in
[Protocol conversion](protocol-conversion.md).
