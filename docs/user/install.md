# Install And First Run

Install the local gateway, launch it, and close the browser tab when you're
done. The rest is mostly convincing your OS that small developers exist.

## Windows 10/11 x64

1. Run the NSIS setup `ocg-manager_<version>_windows-x64-setup.exe`. It
   installs for the current user without administrator rights.
2. Launch **OCG Manager** from the Start menu. The dashboard opens in your
   system browser; use the tray icon to open it again later.
3. Current Windows builds are unsigned, so SmartScreen may warn. Click
   **More info → Run anyway** to continue.
4. Add an OpenCode-Go account in the **Accounts** view, copy the Key,
   and point your client at `http://127.0.0.1:9042/v1`.
5. The uninstaller asks whether to delete `%USERPROFILE%\.ocg-mgr`; silent
   upgrades and uninstalls preserve it.

## macOS 11+ Intel / Apple Silicon

1. Open the Universal DMG and drag **OCG Manager** to **Applications**.
2. The app is ad-hoc signed, so the first launch may be blocked. Open
   **Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.
3. Launch the app. The dashboard opens in your system browser; use the tray
   icon to reopen it. Add an account, copy the Key, and configure
   your client.

## Linux x64

1. Verify the download against `SHA256SUMS` first.
2. Install the `.deb` with your package manager, or mark the AppImage
   executable with `chmod +x ocg-manager_<version>_linux-x64.AppImage`.
3. Launch the executable. The dashboard opens in your system browser; use the
   tray icon to reopen it.
4. Data lives in `~/.ocg-mgr/`.

If you enable auto-start on Windows, the app resumes from the tray and leaves the browser closed.
