# Data And Security

OCG Manager stores your keys, passwords, and browser sessions on the local disk.
Protect the data directory: there is no remote recovery if it is lost.

- **GUI data location.** Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.ocg-mgr`. macOS / Linux:
  `~/.ocg-mgr`. CLI data defaults to `~/.ocg-mgr-cli` on every platform and
  can be overridden with `--data-dir <path>`.
- **Credential storage.** Account keys and saved login passwords are
  obfuscated before storage; this is not cryptographic protection. Dashboard
  Access Keys live in `access_keys` (schema v27). The macOS / Linux GUI and
  the CLI also place a `.encryption-key` file inside the data directory;
  **back it up with the database** because losing it makes stored credentials
  unreadable. Obfuscation is not a security boundary: anyone with the data
  directory and its `.encryption-key`, or able to run the Windows GUI in the
  original Windows user/machine context, can recover account keys and saved
  login passwords. The dashboard SPA never writes Key plaintext to
  `localStorage`; Connection Center secrets stay in memory until logout or
  401.
- **Browser profiles.** `browser-profiles/`, or Docker's
  `ocg-browser-profiles`, contains long-lived cookies and official-site login
  state and is not encrypted by OCG Manager at all. Protect, transfer, and
  destroy it with the same care as the database and account keys.
- **Portable node backup.** Each node manages its own accounts through its own
  dashboard. Move portable node state with a password-encrypted `.ocgbackup`
  file from the loopback dashboard; no separate administrator step-up is
  required. Account and Access Keys are encrypted with Argon2id plus
  AES-256-GCM. The migration password is not stored and cannot be recovered.
  Treat the file and password as separate secrets. Browser profiles, login
  passwords, logs, usage, source cooldown state, and machine-local host
  settings are not included.
- **Plain HTTP warning.** A non-loopback `http://` root URL exposes the Key
  and request contents to the network. Use HTTPS or a trusted LAN only.
- **Administrator password.** The single administrator password is stored as
  an Argon2 hash in SQLite. There is no self-service password recovery —
  protect the data directory.
- **Custom API destinations.** Complete Custom inference Endpoints are
  administrator-trusted. Any syntactically valid HTTP or HTTPS destination is
  allowed, including LAN and loopback. URL-embedded credentials are rejected;
  query strings and fragments are rejected; redirects are never
  followed; dashboard and client credentials are never forwarded. Choose
  destinations you intend to reach from this node.
